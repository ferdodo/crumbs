						Crumbs is a web component library
						that you can use to build your own website.
					</crumbs-p>

					<crumbs-p>
						<b>Why crumbs ?</b>
					</crumbs-p>

					<crumbs-p>
						It's technical successor one of my other project
						called <i>cookies-ds</i>. And it obviously needed a
						better name.
					</crumbs-p>						

					<crumbs-p>
						<b>Purpose</b>
					</crumbs-p>

					<crumbs-p>
						This library implements my own taste in design,
						and is meant for me, ME ALONE. But it's totally
						fine to be used by anyone.
					</crumbs-p>

					<crumbs-p>
						<b>Customization</b>
					</crumbs-p>

					<crumbs-p>
						It's designed to be easily themed by adding your own background,
						and is optimized to work best for bright and colorful images.
					</crumbs-p>

					<crumbs-p>
						Crumbs does not provide a text font nor a color system, as it's intented
						to let you choose your own if you even need one.
					</crumbs-p>

					<crumbs-p>
						<b>Touch screens</b>
					</crumbs-p>

					<crumbs-p>
						It's intented to be easily usable on touch screens, simply by
						having big enough text and interactive elements.
					</crumbs-p>
